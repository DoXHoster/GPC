# GPC
GPC is a C-based language designed to enhance your gaming experience through personalized MACROs on DEMAND (aka M.O.D.s). Used to program the Cronus Zen &amp; CronusMAX devices, it works by enabling the use of third-party controllers and input devices on consoles for which they were not originally designed.
